## Regular expression toolkit - Group-030 (uwutever) Course Project
This repository was originally created as a course project for 
**[CSC207H1: Software Design](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc207h1)**, an introductory course about 
Software Design at the University of Toronto, in the Fall 2021 term.

Our project aims to facilitate the teaching of regular expressions in computational language theory by providing features such
as matching between text strings and  a regular expression, and visualization of Finite State Automata (*FSA*).

## Phase 1 instructions:

#### Back-end
To see the back-end demo, please visit src/test/demo/DemoPhase1 and follow the instructions there to use the CLI for text-matching

#### Front-end

### UI Demo:

![UI demo 1](reports/phase1/img/State1.png "State 1")
![UI demo 2](reports/phase1/img/State2.png "State 2")
![UI demo 3](reports/phase1/img/State3.png "State 3")
![UI demo 4](reports/phase1/img/State4.png "State 4")

Phase 2 plans: implementing pattern matching to meet specifications, and visualizing ASTs, FSAs in GUI.
