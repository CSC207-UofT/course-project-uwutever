## Regular expression toolkit
### Group-030 Course Project
This repository was originally created as a course project for **CSC207H1: Software Design**, an introductory course on
the topic at the University of Toronto, in the Fall 2021 term.

Our project aims to facilitate the teaching of regular expressions in computational language theory by providing features such
as text string and regular expression matching and Finite State Automata (*FSA*) visualization.
