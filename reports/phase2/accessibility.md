## Principle of Universal Design

### 1. Equitable Use

#### What we need to do:

We should make our design useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.

#### What we did:

We use high contrast color scheme to make the design more accessible for people with low vision.
Also, with the help of android accessibility tools and material design framework, screen reader is able to read the content of the page. This will help blind people to use our app.

### 2. Flexibility in use

#### What we need to do:

We should make our design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.

#### What we did:

Our app give user the freedom of writing their own regex and their own text. This meets the individual preferences of the users.

### 3. Simple and intuitive

#### What we need to do:

We should make our design easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.

#### What we did:

Our app uses hint to tell users what to do. Also, the following material design features:

- Clearly visible elements
- Sufficient contrast and size
- A clear hierarchy of importance
- Key information discernable at a glance 

gives our users intuitive user experience. We help our users navigate our app by designing clear layouts with distinct calls to action.

### 4. Perceptible information

#### What we need to do:

We should make our design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.

#### What we did:

The big text input with necessary hint is designed to be easily read by the user. Also, the big buttons communicates the necessary information to the user.

### 5. Tolerance for error

#### What we need to do:

We should make our design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.

#### What we did:

We use text field so the user can change the error if they made typo. Also, the ability to enter history regex from main screen gives the robust experience to user. If the user makes mistake, they can easily change the error.

### 6. Low physical effort

#### What we need to do:

We should make our design be used efficiently and comfortably, and with a minimum of fatigue.

#### What we did:

Single button is enough to navigate to the next phase of our app. Also, the design of the app is minimal and easy to use.

### 7. Size and space for approach and use

#### What we need to do:

We should make our design provides appropriate size and space for approach, reach, manipulation, and use, regardless of the user's body size, posture, or mobility.

#### What we did:

We make our text field and button as large as possible so the people with Parkinson disease could use our app as desired. Also, we use large font size to make the text more readable.

## Target Market

We target our market as computer programmer and students learning regex. We also target people who are interested in regex and want to learn regex.

## Usability of certain demographic groups

We don't think any demographic group will encounter any problem with our app. We think our app is suitable for all people.
