### Progress Report

At this point, we have decided our project domain, `An Android app that allows you to creating, testing, simplifying, and visualizing regular expression.`. We have also made our CRC model consist of several entities and two use case. Our skeleton program shows how our program will be like in the future. The success of CRC model and skeleton program make us believe our design is efficient and necessary. As for phase 0, Kevin wrote the skeleton program and gives the project domain and initial design idea. Choudhury wrote the test. Hanrui, Letian and Brian made the CRC model PPT together. Moreover, Hanrui picked out a few faults in our initial CRC model and fixed it; Brian wrote an detailed specification; Letian wrote this progress report. On the next part, Kevin, Choudhury, Yeung and Brian will implement the algorithm part of our program and Hanrui, Letian will focus on UI design. We are really confident on our project domain since it's unique and makes learing regex easier. We are looking forward to next phase of the project. We genuinely thanks teammates, TAs and Profs of making this project happens.
