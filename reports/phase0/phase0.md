### Skeleton Program

For the initial skeleton of the program, please refer 
to the source code and test functions outlined in the 
GitHub repository. 
The purpose of our skeletal code is to demonstrate 
the primary aspects of our program and how it is 
predicted to like in the final completed version 
of the project.
We currently use a basic CLI to interact with the 
skeleton program, but aim to soon switch over to 
use an Android-based UI created by ourselves.
Furthermore, since our main intention for this phase 
was to merely provide a proof of functionality, we 
utilize IntelliJ's in-built regex engine, instead of 
our own regex engine. This proved to be optimal as 
it successfully demonstrated all aspects of the 
initial scenario walk-through This shall be replaced with our 
own regex compiler when it is completed.


### Progress Report

#### Project domain
We have decided our project domain shall be to 
create an application that aids working with 
regular expressions.
Formally, the goal of this project is stated as  
`Creating an Android application that allows you 
to create, test, simplify, and visualize any given
regular expression.`. 

#### CRC Model and Scenario walk-through
According to the principles outlined in the course,
we have organized our CRC model into several 
entities and two use cases, as outlined in the 
presentation slides linked above. 

We use the success of the scenario walk-through 
based on the CRC model with the existing 
skeleton program to claim our design is 
efficient and necessary. 
We are confident that every part of the current
structure is essential in ensuring that the 
program will satisfy all given specifications.

#### Individual contributions to Project
Currently, Kevin wrote a majority of the skeleton 
program and was a key contributor in choosing the 
project domain and initial design idea. 

Arkaprava wrote the unit test functions and 
modified certain parts of the skeleton code, 
such as the structure for the automata. 

The CRC model was sketched out in a group meeting, 
and Hanrui, Letian and Chonho share the credit for 
taking the responsibility of completing the CRC 
model presentation together. In particular, we credit
Hanrui and Chonho for identifying some faults in our 
initial CRC model and proposing appropriate solutions.

Chonho also wrote a detailed specification, which
proved invaluable in providing a concrete list of
goals to work towards achieving.

This progress report was jointly created by Letian and Arkaprava.

In the next phase(s), Kevin, Arkaprava, Yeung and Chonho
will implement the algorithm part of our program
and Hanrui, Letian will focus on UI design.

We are confident and optimistic about the success
of our project domain due to its unique and vast
applicability in making learning regex easier.
We are looking forward to next phase of the project.
We genuinely thank the TAs and Professors for
granting us this opportunity and the freedom to work
on making this project a reality.
