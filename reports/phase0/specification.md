We intend to build a tool for providing assistance in learning Regular Expression in computational language theory.

When a regular expression is compiled, it is converted into an equivalent Finite State Automata (FSA) which is an abstract concept yet can be easily visualized.

Our software provides the following features:
- As a Regex tool, it should be able to preform matching between a given regular expression and a given text
- The corresponding FSA can be visualized on the interface. Including the start state, every transition states and the end state
