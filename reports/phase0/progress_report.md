### Progress Report

#### Project domain
We have decided our project domain shall be to
create an application that aids working with
regular expressions.
Formally, the goal of this project is stated as  
`Creating an Android application that allows you
to create, test, simplify, and visualize any given
regular expression.`.

#### CRC Model and Scenario walk-through
According to the principles outlined in the course, we
have organized our CRC model into several entities and
two use cases. The success of CRC model and skeleton
program make us believe our design is efficient and
necessary.

#### Individual contributions to Project
Currently, Kevin wrote a majority of the skeleton
program and was a key contributor in choosing the
project domain and initial design idea.

Arkaprava wrote the unit test functions and
modified certain parts of the skeleton code,
such as the structure for the automata.

The CRC model was sketched out in a group meeting,
and Hanrui, Letian and Chonho share the credit for
taking the responsibility of completing the CRC
model presentation together. In particular, we credit
Hanrui and Chonho for identifying some faults in our
initial CRC model and proposing appropriate solutions.

Chonho also wrote a detailed specification, which 
proved invaluable in providing a concrete list of 
goals to work towards achieving.

This progress report was jointly created by Letian and Arkaprava.

In the next phase(s), Kevin, Arkaprava, Yeung and Chonho 
will implement the algorithm part of our program 
and Hanrui, Letian will focus on UI design. 

We are confident and optimistic about the success 
of our project domain due to its unique and vast
applicability in making learning regex easier. 
We are looking forward to next phase of the project. 
We genuinely thank the TAs and Professors for 
granting us this opportunity and the freedom to work
on making this project a reality.
