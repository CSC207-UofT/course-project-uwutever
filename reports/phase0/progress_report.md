## Progress Report (Phase 0)

Over the past few weeks, we have arranged one in-person meeting and several online meetings,
during which we have laid out a plan for the next steps of our project. This document is a progress report
detailing what we've accomplished so far and our expectations for the future.

#### Project domain
We have decided that our project domain shall be to
create an application that aids working with
regular expressions.
Formally, the goal of this project is stated as  
`Creating an Android application that allows users
to create, test, simplify, and visualize any given
regular expression`.

#### Specification
There will be two use cases for our finished program.

1. Matching of an input text string to the language defined by an input regular expression.
2. Visualizing a Finite State Automata which satisfies the language described by the input regular expression.

Detailed specification of this project can be found in the corresponding file,
located in the same directory as this document.

#### CRC Model and Scenario walk-through
According to the principles outlined in the course, we
have organized our CRC model into several entities and
two use cases. The successful CRC modelling and skeleton
program make us believe that our design is efficient and
necessary.

#### Individual contributions to Project
For Phase 0, Kevin wrote the majority of the skeleton
program and was a key contributor in choosing the
project domain and initial design idea.

Arkaprava wrote the unit test functions and
modified certain parts of the skeleton code,
such as the structure for the automata.

The CRC model was sketched out in a group meeting,
and Hanrui, Letian and Brian (Man Chon) share the credit for
taking the responsibility of completing the CRC
model presentation together. In particular, we credit
Hanrui and Brian for identifying some faults in our
initial CRC model and proposing appropriate solutions.

Brian also wrote a detailed specification, which 
will be invaluable in providing a concrete list of 
goals to work towards achieving. Franklin later elaborated on it and made some minor edits.

This progress report was jointly created by Letian, Arkaprava, and Franklin.

In the coming phases, Kevin, Arkaprava, Franklin and Brian 
will implement the algorithm part of our program 
and Hanrui, Letian will focus on UI design, depending on their workload,
Kevin and Franklin might assist with the UI part as well.

We are confident and optimistic about the success 
of our project domain due to its unique and vast
applicability in making understanding regular expressions easier. 
We are looking forward to next phase of the project. 
We genuinely thank the TAs and Professors for 
granting us the resources and freedom to work
on making this concept a reality.
