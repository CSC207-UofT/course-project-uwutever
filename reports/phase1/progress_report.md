## Progress Report (Phase 1)
FrontEnd: We finish the most part of the front end. We have a working front end with database, history and add function now. 
Our next step will be beautifying the front end, add some features and make it more user friendly (like `delete all` and `about`).
We also need to add visualization for the regex objects, and intergrate with the backend on the next phase. 

The frontend is developed by `HanruiJerryFan` and `RealFakeAccount`.
To specify, `HanruiJerryFan` did the activities and the view models.
`HanruiJerryFan` also did the Adapter and the click function for reviewing the history regex.
`RealFakeAccount` did the database and its interface, together with the activity chain of the activities.

I (`RealFakeAccount`) would like thanks to `HanruiJerryFan` for the hard work and the help during the whole UI development.
He is really responsible and friendly person, and a quick learner. I am really glad to have him as a part of our team.
